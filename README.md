This is where I push code and notes for all self-taught material!

Whenever I forget anything I have learned, looking for the right resources to jog my memory is more time consuming than
it should be. This repo's purpose is to summarize the learning process and help me remember things quickly and efficiently.
It is not meant to be a full comprehensive reference -- I believe that detailed explanations are best left to more 
authoritative sources such as books and official guides, where they are kept up to date by experts in the field.
