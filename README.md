# :books: :school_satchel:

This is where I push code and notes for all self-taught material.

Whenever I forget something I have learned, looking for the right resources to
jog my memory is more time consuming than it should be. This repo's purpose is
to summarize the learning process and help me remember things quickly and
efficiently. It is not meant to be a full comprehensive reference; detailed
explanations are best left to more authoritative sources such as books and
official guides, where they are kept up to date by experts in the field. For this
purpose, sources will be cited in my notes.

This repo also serves as a reminder for me to learn in a structured and
sequential manner. Although tempting, taking shortcuts often leads to wasted
time in the long run. Putting up my notes and learning process should help
by prompting me to organize everything in a presentable manner.
