Learning is a lifelong process; we never really leave the classroom.
This is where I push code and notes for all self-taught material. The purpose 
of this repo is to summarize the learning process and help me remember things quickly and
efficiently. It also serves as a reminder to learn in a structured manner, and 
not to take shortcuts.
