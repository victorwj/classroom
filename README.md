Learning is a lifelong process.
This is where I push code and notes for all self-taught material. The purpose 
of this repo is to summarize the learning process and help me remember things quickly and
efficiently. This repo is also a reminder to learn in a structured manner, not 
to take shortcuts, and try something new every now and then.
